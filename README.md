This is a full-stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) participant tracking application using [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/javascript/tutorial/deploy-nodejs-mongodb-app-service-from-visual-studio-code).

## Description

<p align="center"> This participant-tracking application was developed purely to exercise Azure software engineering.  That being said, an Express server locally hosts the application on port 8080 with a React server-side view, with the MongoDB native API in the back-end.</p>

<p align="center"> While this application solely focused on functionality (so no CSS was applied), users are able to enjoy the cloud-deployed functionality of adding and deleting inputs.  That being said, anyone with access to the URL may modify the application.</p>

## Roadmap

This participant-tracking application is an on-going project, open to contributions and critique.  Functionality that would appropriately flesh out the application (aside from adding CSS) include the following:
1) create a separate page to track participants by date
2) include media queries for added responsiveness
3) add a dropdown menu for additional functionality
4) adding user authentication so only specific individuals may modify the application
